# ERC 20 Token Bridge
A Hardhat project with token bridge smart contracts, CLI actions, and a smart contract events listener can be found in this repository. The parsed events are stored and retrieved from a Postgres DB using the other app, an Express.js API.

Please review the README files for each project.
